
  Inspite of astonishing achievements in the field of science and technology, nature still remains a mystery for human beings. 
  Even though water makes up most of the surface of the earth, drinking water or clean water only makes up a small portion of it.
	
	We, with OPTIMUS2030, is planing to setup a smart water filtration system that collects rainwater, filters it using various methods or 
  filtration systems to produce clean and healthy water. With global warming and rising temperature, water requirement is going up day by day. 
  This system can be used in every house or can later be modified and used as water source for several commercial irrigation projects as well.
