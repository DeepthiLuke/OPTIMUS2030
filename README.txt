Inspite of astonishing achievements in the field of science and technology, nature still remains a mystery for human beings. Even though water makes up most of the surface of the earth, drinking water or clean water only makes up a small portion of it. We, with OPTIMUS2030, is planing to setup a smart water filtration system that collects rainwater, filters it using various methods or filtration systems to produce clean and healthy water. With global warming and rising temperature, water requirement is going up day by day. This system can be used in every house or can later be modified and used as water source for several commercial irrigation projects as well.
	
	The whole process of rainwater harvesting includes several steps. The rain water that falls on roofs of buildings is made to flow through pipes into a filter. The filter identifies the impurities and conducts processes to remove them. The clean water is then passed into a main tank. The main tank will have two outlets, one goes to a water pump and the other is lead to a well by an overflow pipe. The well helps collect excess water from the tank and also help to replenish ground water. The pump sends out the clean water from the main tank to several outputs. With OPTIMUS2030 we concentrate on the filter. Different sensors will be programmed to work collectively to figure out the impurities and work out proper solutions to remove it. 
	
	The filteration system is run by a micro controller (ESP32) which recieves, processes and analyze data. The data is then sent instantaneously to the monitoring center by Blynk app (the app provides a sever for us to save and view the data). If the water quality is not in par with the management's requirement, the data will be sent to the monitoring center and the management's mobile. This makes it convinient to check the water quality or get updates remotely. The system consists of several sensors that measure the essential parameters for water quality. The data recieved from the sensors is processed by ESP32 (micro-controller) and the processed data is transffered remotely. Finally, the processed data can be viewed on an internet browser or an application.

	Our proposed system will offer smart automated solution, which are less complex, without neglecting the main objective. The project is also aimed at sustainable develelopment, the more that we harvest the more there is for the future.
