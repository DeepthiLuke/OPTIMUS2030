
Inspite of astonishing achievements in the field of science and technology, nature still remains a mystery for human beings. 
Even though water makes up most of the surface of the earth, drinking water or clean water only makes up a small portion of it.
	
	We, with OPTIMUS2030, is planing to setup a smart water filtration system that collects rainwater, filters it using various methods or 
filtration systems to produce clean and healthy water. With global warming and rising temperature, water requirement is going up day by day. 
This system can be used in every house or can later be modified and used as water source for several commercial irrigation projects as well.
	
	The whole process of rainwater harvesting includes several steps. The rain water that falls on roofs of buildings is made to flow through 
pipes into a filter. The filter identifies the impurities and conducts processes to remove them. The clean water is then passed into a main tank. 
The main tank will have two outlets, one goes to a water pump and the other is lead to a well by an overflow pipe. The well helps collect excess 
water from the tank and also help to replenish ground water. The pump sends out the clean water from the main tank to several output. With OPTIMUS2030 
we are concente on the filter. Different sensors will be programmed to work collectively to figure out the impurities and work out proper solutions to remove it.
